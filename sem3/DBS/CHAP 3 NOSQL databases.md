# NOSQL #EXP 
- NOSQL is a type of database management system that is designed to handle and store large volumes of unstructured and semi structured data.
- The term NOSQL originally referred to non SQL or non relational databases but the term as since evolved to mean not only SQL.
- NOSQL databases are often used in applications where there is a high volume of data that needs to be processed and analyzed in real time.
- NOSQL databass are not suitable for all applications as they do not provide the same level of data consistency and transactional guarantees as traditional relational databases.
# Features of NOSQL #EXP 
## Schema Flexibility #DEF 
NOSQL databases often allow for dynamic schemas meaning the structure of the data can change without needing to alter a predefined schema. This is useful for applications where data types and structures are constantly changed
## Scalability 
Many NOSQL databases are designed to scale out horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers. This allows them to be handled large volumes of data and high velocity transactions more eficiently than vertical scaling.
## High Performance
NOSQL databases are optimized for performance with various data models and indexing techniques, they can handle high speed read and write operations, making them suitable for real time applications
# High availability and fault tolerance
NOSQL databases are often designed with built in replication and distribution features to ensure high availability and fault tolerance this means they can continue to operate even if some parts of the system fail.
## Eventual Consistency
Unlike relational databases that often use strong consistency models, many NOSQL databases that often use strong consistency control. This allows for high availability and partition tolerance, not all nodes may have the most recent data at all times because of this
approach
## Distributed Architecture
