This allows them to handle large volumes of data and high velocity transactions more efficiently.\n- High Performance: NOSQL databases are optimized for performance with various data models and indexing techniques. they can handle high speed read and writes, making them suitable for real time applications\n- High Availability and fault tolerance: NOSQL databases are often designed with builtin replication and distribution features to ensure high availability and fault tolerance, this means they can continue to operate even if some parts of the system fail.\n- Eventual Consistency: unlike RDBMS that often use strong consistency models, many NOSQL dbs use eventual consistency.\n- Easy integration with big data technologies: NOSQL dbs are frequently used alongside big data technologies such as hadoop and spark. providing a robust solution for handling large scale data processing and analytics\n- Flexible QUery Languages: NOSQL dbs often come with their own query tailored to their specific data models, offering different querying capabilities compared to SQL\n---\n# Types of NOSQL dbs #EXP \n- Document based: These dbs store data as semi structured documents such as JSON or XML and can be queried using document oriented query languages eg: MongoDB, cloudant\n- Key valued store: These dbs store data as key value pairs and are optimized for simple and fast read write operations eg: Memcached, Redis\n- Column family stores: These dbs store data as column families which are sets of columns that are treated as single entity. they are optimized for fast and efficient querying of large amounts of data. eg:Hbase, Big table\n- Graph dbs: these databases store data as nodes and edges, and are designed to handle complex relationships between data. eg:  amazon neptune, neo4j\n---\n# Benefits of NOSQL dbs #EXP \n- Flexibility: NOSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi structured data which means that they can accommodate dynamic changes to the data model.\n- High Availability: The auto replication feature in NOSQL dbs make them highly available because in case of any failure data replicates itself to previous consistent state\n- Scalability: NOSQL databases are highly scalable which means that they can handle large amounts of data and traffic with eaase. THis makes them a good fit for applications that need to handle large amounts of data or traffic\n- Performance: NOSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and traffic which means that they can offer improved performance compared to traditional RBDMS\n- Cost effectiveness: NOSQL dbs are often more cost effective than tradtional RDBMS as they are typically less complex and do not require expensive hardware or software\n- Agikity: IDEAL for agile development."},

Simplicity\n 2. Scalability\n 3. Speed\n ---\n# Column Oriented databases:\n- A column oriented database is a non relational database that stores the data in columns instead of rows, that means when we want to run analytics on a small number of columns you can read those columns directly without consuming memory with unwanted data\n- Columnar databases are designed to read data more efficiently and retrieve the data with greater speed. A columnar database is used to store a large amount of data\n## Key features of columnar oriented databases:\n1. Scalability \n2. Compression\n3. Very Responsive\n--- \n# Graph Based databases:\n- Graph based databases focus on the relationship between elements. it stores the data in the form of nodes in the database the connections between the nodes are called links\n## Key features of graph based databases:\n1. It is easy to identify the relationship between the data by using the links\n2. The query’s output is real time results\n3. the speed depends upon the number of relationships \n4. updating data is easy, as adding a new node or edge is a straightforward task that does not require significant schema changes"},
